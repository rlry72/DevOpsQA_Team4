## Flow for working as a QA for new tasks
1. Get the tasks assigned in the Dev repo Kanban board here (https://github.com/zengzihui/DevOps_Oct2021_Team04/projects/1)  
2. Move the task from QA Backlog Task to In progress in the Kanban board and start work on the tasks 
3. If task is test scripts, create a new branch in QA repo here  
4. Once tasks are done, move the task in Kanban board from In progress to In Review  
5. In the task issue, tag the QA lead (or if you are the QA lead, tag another QA member) to review the test cases/test scripts  
6. If the task is test scripts, create a pull request in QA repo  
7. Assign yourself in the pull request and add the person tagged above as Reviewer and link the issue from the Dev repo in the pull request as shown in image below

8. If any changes are requested in the review, make your changes and push to the same branch you created for the task  
9. Once review is done and no other changes to be made, Reviewer will close issue and pull request with 'lgtm' or '+1'  

## Flow for working as a QA for any issues on test scripts
1. QA lead will create an issue in Dev repo if there are any issues on test scripts, and assign someone to fix (QA lead included)  
2. Assigned QA will create a new branch in QA repo here  
3. QA will start working in new branch to solve issue  
4. Once done, QA will create a pull request here  
5. QA will tag someone else other than themselves as Reviewer and assign themselves as well as link the issue from Dev repo in the pull request like so:

6. Reviewer will run updated test scripts manually on their own machine to check  
7. If there are changes requested, Reviewer will outline where and QA will resolve those requests  
8. Once change requests are resolved (if any), Reviewer will close the pull request with 'lgtm' or '+1'
